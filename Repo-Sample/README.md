## Abstract
<details>
  <summary>Detail</summary>
  1. Motivation: A dart board game is a fun way to pass free time . Along with being fun ,it can
be a useful tool to help hone certain skills within individual. It is a game of accuracy requiring
perfection in timing .Through this project we are implementing a way to play dart game using
digital circuits. Here by implementing a digital circuit with speed control and scoreboard we
can easily record the score while also making appropriate changes in the game difficulty as the
game progresses thus adding an extra layer of adaptibility and suspense !

2. Problem Statement: The dart board game should be digital . It should accept a signal as
an input source to simulate the throw of a dart on a dartboard. The dartboard should possess
sufficiently large number of different target regions with the bulls eye being the most difficult
to hit. There should be some variation in the game to add some difficulty . The scoreboard
must record game points over a sufficiently large range without overflow.

3. Features: The dartboard uses the input signal of a dart which is thrown over as a time
varying pointer pointing periodically between 4 target regions which are placed as concentric
circles lit by LEDs to signify the positioning of the pointer there. The scoreboard can record
atleast 20 throws without overflow. The dartboard has a variable speed controller to change
the speed of the pointerâ€™s change in position. The game can be played by three players .
